# UpCloud ads for Discourse theme Battle Axe

Copyright (c) 2018 Tappara.co. Released under the MIT license.

In this repository we host the UpClouds ads for the theme [Battle Axe](https://github.com/osmoossi/discourse-theme-Battle-Axe) as a separate theme.

This theme contains the branding of our hosting partner https://upcloud.com. For them we have implemented locally served ads to the header and footer areas. These will not be blocked by generic adblockers, thus providing new commercial opportunities for fellow Discourse admins. These code snippets include a Google Analytics OnClick tracking event, so modify accordingly

If you find this theme useful, a link back to https://tappara.co is appreciated.
